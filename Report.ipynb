        "Counted the number of emails per day, week, and month using strftime and COUNT() functions.\n",
        "Identified the top senders and recipients by aggregating data from the Message and Recipientinfo tables.\n",
        "Categorized emails by recipient type using the rtype column in the Recipientinfo table.\n",
        "Loaded the query results into Pandas dataframes.\n",
        "Performed data manipulation tasks such as filtering, grouping, and aggregation.\n",
        "Cleaned and preprocessed the data, addressing any missing or inconsistent values.\n",
        "Data Visualization and Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "Visualized the email traffic over time using line charts:\n",
        "Plotted the number of emails per day, week, and month.\n",
        "Analyzed the trends and patterns in email volume.\n",
        "Identified the top senders and recipients using bar charts:\n",
        "Plotted the number of emails sent by each sender and received by each recipient.\n",
        "Analyzed the most active communicators in the dataset.\n",
        "Analyzed the distribution of emails by recipient type using a pie chart:\n",
        "Visualized the proportion of emails sent to each recipient type ('to', 'cc', 'bcc').\n",
        "Examined the communication practices within the organization.\n",
        "Extracted keywords from email subjects and analyzed their frequency using a word cloud or horizontal bar chart:\n",

        "Determined the proportion of internal and external communication using a pie chart or stacked bar chart:\n",
        "Compared email addresses in the Message and Recipientinfo tables with those in the Employeelist table.\n",
        "Analyzed the extent of internal and external interactions.\n",
        "Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "Through the analysis of the Enron email dataset, several insights were gained into the communication patterns, popular topics, and organizational structure of Enron.\n",
        "The email traffic analysis revealed the volume of emails sent over time and identified peak periods of communication.\n",
        "The top senders and recipients analysis provided an understanding of the most active communicators within the organization.\n",
        "The email distribution by recipient type analysis highlighted the communication practices and patterns of Enron employees.\n",
        "The subject keyword analysis offered insights into the common topics discussed in the emails.\n",
        "The internal vs. external communication analysis provided a perspective on the proportion of internal and external interactions within Enron.\n",
        "Limitations of the analysis include the need for further context and domain knowledge to interpret the findings accurately.\n",
        "Possible improvements include incorporating network analysis to understand social connections and conducting sentiment analysis for a deeper understanding of the email content.\n",
        "Overall, the Enron email dataset analysis provides valuable insights into the communication dynamics and organizational structure of Enron Corporation, contributing to the existing research on workplace communication patterns and social networks."
